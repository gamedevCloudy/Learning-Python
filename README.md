# Learning-Python
This is a repo for learning DSA with python.  

Till now I only learnt the basics of any language - varaible, operators, arrays, fucntions and thats it. 

Never bothered myslef to learn Data Structures and Algorithms, just becuse I never needed them when working on games. 

I'm just a beginner afterall ðŸ˜“, so, doing this will help me, hopefully :)
